# Covid Status

I created this project to display the COVID-19 updates in a way I think is more clear.
All the "number" are retrieved from the [Ministero della Salute](https://www.salute.gov.it/), they have made available all the data in a public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).

## Requirements:
* JVM 11

## Optional:
* Docker
