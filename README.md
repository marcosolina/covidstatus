# Covid Status

I created this project to display the COVID-19 updates in a way I think is more clear.
All the "number" are retrieved from the [Ministero della Salute](https://www.salute.gov.it/), they have made available all the data in a public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).

## Requirements:
* JVM 11
* Docker

## TODO:
* Retrieve the data from the public repo **(Done)**
* Store the data in the DB **(Done)**
* Create a simple UI to display the raw data **(Done)**

* UI Restile
* Refactor the UI Code
* Anything else that cames up in my mind
