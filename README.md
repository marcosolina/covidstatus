# Covid Status

I created this SpringBoot project to display the COVID-19 updates in a way I think is more clear.
All the "number" are retrieved from the [Ministero della Salute](https://www.salute.gov.it/), they have made available all the data in a public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).

## Requirements:
* JDK 11
* Maven 3.x.x
* Database (PostgreSQL)

## Info
* I am providing a **docker file** that you can use to run and initialise the database. You will find it insider the folde: Scripts/Docker/PostgreSQL/*

## Screenshots

![Regions Data](Misc/Pictures/2.png)

## TODO:
* Refactoring the code
* Anything else that cames up in my mind
