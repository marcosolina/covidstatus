# Covid Status

I created this project to display the COVID-19 updates in a way I think is more clear.
All the "number" are retrieved from the [Ministero della Salute](https://www.salute.gov.it/), they have made available all the data in a public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).

## Requirements:
* JVM 11
* Database (PostgreSQL)

## Info
I am providing a **docker file** that you can use to run and initialise the database.

## TODO:
* Schedule service improvements
* Integration testing
* Improve the UI
* Add region chart
* Anything else that cames up in my mind
